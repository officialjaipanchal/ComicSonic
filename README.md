## ðŸ“– What is This Project About?

Visual storytelling is powerful â€” but not always accessible. This project converts English-written **Manhwa** (Korean webcomics) and **Comic Books** into audio narrations using state-of-the-art AI tools, bridging the gap between traditional reading and modern-day audio content.

ðŸ“ˆ With the Webtoon industry booming ($8B+ market growing at 27% CAGR), this project creates a scalable, fast alternative to long production pipelines like animations or anime.
